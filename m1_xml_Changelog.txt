06/24/2015 - 1921 Sets

Corrected issue with seibuSPI games and cleared the SHA1 out.  Somewhere along
the line it got "0" filled and it would no longer load.  If you don't have an
older MAME with the merged .nv of a successful initialization for the SeibuSPI
games, you can use the current MAME's file output in the nvram\(setname) and
merge the file back together.  Unforunately, the M1 Core is rigid and will only
work properly with an all-inclusive .NV file.  So, in windows:

copy /b ds2404. + soundflash1. + soundflash2. = (setname).nv

There are 5 total sets now for Seibu SPI:
rfjet
rfdt
rfdtj *newly added*
viprp1
viprp1j

Wizard Fire and Dark Seal 2 (wizdfire, darkseal2) both have redumped sample roms.

Added:
Ken Sei Mogura to CPS-1 Driver - Thanks to Soregashi!

Changed:
Had to set up Namco NA 1/2 and Some Namco S22 games with fake parents
since device MCU's were set up.  (namcoc69, namcoc70, namcoc74).
These Sets include:
bkrtmaq, cgangpzl, exvania, fghtatck, swcourt, tinklpit = namcoc69
emeralda, knckhead, numanath, quiztou, xday2 = namcoc70
acedrvrw, cybrcomm, ridgerac, ridgera2, victlapw = namcoc74

NOTE: Set "ridgeracf" requires manual addition of "namcoc74" romset
inside if you wish to use since it already has a parent in "ridgerac".
It is either do that, or drop from M1 list.

ssf2 - changed audio cpu rom

Data Sync to MAME 0.155


7/25/2014 - 1919 Sets
puzldama  ->  crzcross

Data Sync to MAME 0.152


10/5/2013 - 1919 Sets
Correct to size in pang3 of audiocpu rom.  It had passed my BridgeM1 audit
for some reason so it was presumed good.

Changed roms in the following sets:
manxtt and truxton

Data sync to MAME 0.150 Romsets

arkretrn, sidebs, superchs, wwfsstars

Data sync to MAME 0.149


1/14/2013
strider2 - changed Qsound rom, but as a result M1 was unable to produce sound
with it.  So, using the old romset, the 4mb sound rom should be in a romset
called "strider2osr".  The normal MAME strider2 will have the cpurom needed.

scfinals, qadj and qtono2j all showed rom changes.

0.148 Data Sync


11/26/2012 - 1919 Sets

0.146u5 Data Sync


7/17/2012 - 1918 Sets
Changed set raiden -> raidenb due to M1 only supporting playing the 
unencrypted sound rom, which is now "raidenb", with raiden also needed
as a parent for the universal "OKI" sample rom.

0.146u3 Data Sync


6/15/2012 - 1918 Sets

Various game data changes to match 0.136u4.


2/16/2010 - 1898 Sets

Added:
Codename: Blut Engel (cnbe) to the Neo Geo driver.  This homebrew Neo Geo CD-based game
has no music, but some sound/voice effects from the game might be of interest.

Changed:
A number of Namco System 22 games now need a new fake parent because the official MAME
roms now include the c76.bin data rather than the old 'pr1data.8k'.  All those sets
which formerly had a fake parent of TEKKEN now have this new fake parent, PROPCYCL.  If
you want to run any of the sets below from the current MAME romset, you'll need at the
very least PROPCYCL, or a zip file with that name containing the old PR1DATA.8K file.
Like before, this will be taken off once the M1 core is updated to support the new .BIN
file(s).  As a result, I took one set out which only has a changed music program, but
the music is the same for Soul Edge (souledge1) since a game cannot have more than 1
parent to provide roms.  It will return once the c76.bin support is added to the M1 core.

Sets with this new fake parent include: danceyes, dunkmnia, finalapr, gslgr94j, gslgr94u,
gslugrsj, machbrkr, myangel3, nebulray, outfxies, pocketrc, primglex, ptblank, ptblnk2a,
souledge, speedrcr, starswep, sws95, tekken, tekken2, vshoot, xevi3dg

gokuparo -> fantjour (Fantastic Journey is now considered the parent rom, with Gokujou
Parodius (gokuparo) now placed as a clone).

indy500 had rom changes in MAME 0.136u3


1/21/2009 - 1898 Sets

Changed:
megab to megablst (Mega Blast (World)) in MAME 0.136u1.

Updated assorted changes to keep current to MAME 0.136u1


12/31/2009 - 1898 Sets

Added:
finlflng (Final Furlong) to the Namco System 12 driver.

Changed:
combasc to combatsc (Combat School).

Sets should be current to MAME 0.136


11/20/2009 - 1897 Sets

Added:
joyman (Joyman) and ctrpllrp (Caterpiller Pacman Hack) to the Pacman driver.  Both games
offer some unique tunes not found in normal Pac-Man sets.

Updated assorted changes to keep current to MAME 0.135u1


11/02/2009 - 1895 Sets

Changed: sdgndmrb to grainbow (SD Gundam Sangokushi Rainbow Tairiku Senki) in MAME 0.135.


10/04/2009 - 1895 Sets

Changed:
nrallyx to nrallyxb (New Rally X).  The new parent set for whatever reason does not work
with current M1 driver.  I hooked up this other set (which was nrallyx before 0.134u2) for
use in M1.

Updated romnames/descriptions to match MAME 0.134u2.


9/28/2009 - 1895 Sets

Fixed:
androdun (Andro Dunos) and exzisus (Exzisus) to match roms used in MAME 0.134u1.


9/17/2009 - 1895 Sets

Fixed:
mk3 (Mortal Kombat 3).  Got proper sound rom requiring a change in the XML in MAME
0.133u4.  This was due to a compiler bug which I worked around to not miss anything
from the initial M1.XML read.

Changes:
Updated data to MAME 0.134


8/20/2009 - 1895 Sets

Added:
dirtdash (Dirt Dash) to the Namco Super System 22 Driver.  This set was added to
MAME in 0.133u3.  There is some oddness and distortion in some tracks which might be
dump and/or emulation related issues.

Changes:
Updated data to MAME 0.133u3.

Rewrote my XML/DATA comparison checking programs to be faster to update as well as
include the HAZEMD items (which the Genesis/Megadrive Information comes from).
This information should be correct.

Renamed:
cuebrckj > cuebrickj to keep in line with MAME.


8/3/2009 - 1894 Sets

Added:
ngfrog (Frog Feast) to the Neo-Geo driver.  There is only one music track, which is the
default track.

Changes:
Updated data to MAME 0.133u1.  This included a large amount (nearly 1000) of setname
changes in MAME involving clone sets.  This had an effect on a couple dozen playable sets
in M1, which the names now reflect the new setnames MAME expects.  The renames are
mentioned below:

aceattaa > aceattaca
airbusb  > airbustrb
aliensy2 > aliensyn2
arknid2j > arknoid2j
arknid2u > arknoid2u

thnderxa > thunderxa
twotigrc > twotigerc


7/10/2009 - 1893 Sets

Added:
polynetw (Polynet Warriors) to the Mystic Warrior driver.  There might be some issues with
the driver as there are tracks which end abruptly (#154 for instance).

pacwc90 (Pac-Man (on Tecmo World Cup '90 Hardware)) to the World Cup '90 driver.
This game, which was coded by a MAMEDEV member nearly 10 years ago (Mike Coates), was
recently mentioned so I dropped into the driver.

Updated data to MAME 0.132u4


7/04/2009 - 1891 Sets

Added:
magtruck (Magical Truck Adventure) to the Model 3 driver.  The percussion sounds a bit
too white noisy, but otherwise a some fine sounding music!

Changes:
minasan (Minnasanno Okagesamadesu) due to changed 027-m1.bin.
Data synced up with MAME 0.132u3

PANICPRK - (Panic Park) to the Namco System 12 Driver (Phil Bennett)
BINGOC - (Bingo Circus) to the System 16 (sound type 1) Driver.  Current driver
is unable to play the samples, but the FM is heard just fine using this driver.
Thanks go to Kale for pointing this set out.

Changed:
NOBB to NOB (Noboranka (Japan)).  In MAME 0.131u1, there were some changes to the
sets bringing the audio rom to the parent.  The XML followed suit by using the
parent instead.


4/26/2009 - 1884 Sets

Changed:
HEAVYUNT to the mame setname that was recently added, HVYUNIT.
A lot of game year entries were corrected taking information from MAME 0.131.


4/17/2009 - 1884 Sets

Added:
XSEDAE (X Se Dae Quiz) to the Raiden II driver.

Changed:
CHPLFT (Choplifter) - Name changed in 0.130u3 to CHOPLIFT and this is now reflected in XML.

Fixed:
FRANKST (Mary Shelley's Frankenstein).  The sound rom mapping was incorrect and caused
incorrect music playback.

Trimmed a number of "offset=" settings of unneeded 0's.  Also, again cleaned up any
forgotten "region=" tags that might have been left in.


4/2/2009 - 1880 sets

Added:
CAMLTRYA (Cameltry - YM2203+M6295).  This is a different sound hardware than the parent
set and was added to the Hit The Ice Driver.

DKGENSAN (Daiku No Gensan (Japan)) to the Item M Series Driver.  This is the Japanese
version of Hammerin' Harry and has some unique voices.

DOGOSOKE (Dogou Souken) to the Psycho Soldier Driver.  Japanese version of Victory
Road with unique voice samples.

SCOBRAS (Super Cobra - Stern License) to Scramble/Super Cobra Driver.  It's odd that the
main set, scobra, doesn't have the opening fanfare after the intro one, like all the clones
and home ports do.


3/20/2009 - 1876 Sets

Added:
REALPNCH (Real Puncher) to the Taito AIR/B/Dual28k/H/F2 System Driver.  Thanks to Phil B.

VBALL had rom changes in 0.129u6
SPLATTER had rom changes in 0.129u6
FINALAPR and SPEEDRCR were set up for the time being with a fake parent: "ROMOF="TEKKEN"
This is due to MAME roms for the above using c75.bin and that M1 still hasn't been updated
to use this file.  The "pr1data.8k" is still in tekken and will be required if you want
these are any sets which are supposed to use c75.bin.


2/20/2009 - 1872 Sets

Added:
SEGAWSKI to the Model 2A/2B/2C profile.

Added:
MOTOXGO to the Namco System 12 profile.

Changes:
GURURIN had rom changes in 0.129


11/26/2008 - 1870 Sets

Added:
ABURNER - Differs in some respects to ABURNER2 in that there are additional/changed sounds.
AIRBUSB - Different sample roms from AIRBUSTR - not sure if sounds are 100% same.
          Requires romof="airbustr".

Changes:
SOLDAMJ changed to SOLDAM in 0.128u4
PBOBBLE2 changed to PBOBBL2O with a romof="pobble2" in 0.128u4
AJAX had rom changes in 0.128u4

11/03/2008 - 1868 Sets

Changes:
TNZSJ changed to TNZSJO in 0.128u1
MAHRETSU has rom changes in 0.128u2
KABUKIZ has a romof="tnzs" which wasn't needed


10/05/2008 - 1868 Sets

Changes:
GP500 was changed to 500GP in 0.127u5
CSCLUB, SONICWI2 had rom changes in 0.127u5

Fixes for the Neo-Geo changes until proper undecrypted sound roms are emulated correctly.
I've set up another fake parent, called "decrypt", which you can put all the decrypted roms
that were taken out of MAME in 0.127u5 and u6 for the following sets:  jockeygp, kof2000,
kof2001, kof2002, kof2003, matrim, mslug4, mslug5, pnyaa, rotd, samsho5, svcpcb
Again, this will be replaced with the MAME roms as soon as a new M1 core is released that
supports the undecrypted sounds roms.


09/22/2008 - 1868 Sets

Knurek made note of some XML corrections for a number of sets.  This update includes
changes to:  g_acro, g_adiv, g_clay, g_ejim, g_ferias, g_ootw, g_pst3, g_rkni


09/20/2008 - 1868 Sets

Added:
The new c75.bin implementation is not compatable with the way M1 produces sound.  For the
time being, a fake parent has been set up for sets which have lost their "pr1data.8k" file
in the MAME rom archives, which is "ROMOF="TEKKEN".  Assuming you have an updated MAME set,
again, this should be rather seemless on your end.
Involved sets:  gslgr94u, gslugrsj, machbrkr, nebulray, outfxies, ptblank, sws95, vshoot

A misplaced genesis set was added:  g_chq2

Removed:
References to usage of the c69.bin in place of the c70.bin in many Namco sets is no longer
needed.  If your MAME sets are updated to the latest developments (0.127u4), c70.bin is now
available and in each games' archive.  This means all the "ROMOF="CGANGPZL" fake parent setup
is no longer needed.  Involved sets:  emeralda, knckhead, numanath, quiztou, xday2

Normal Gamename/Romname changes to match up with 0.127u4.


09/05/2008 - 1867 Sets

Added:
A lot of Genesis titles (most which need a core update to work) from Knurek.  I added
them now to simplify my ability to keep the list updated.  If a title doesn't work only
after the next M1 core is released, you need to let R. Belmont know at his forum.
http://www.bannister.org/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=postlist&Board=2

Alpine Ski and Wild Western added to Taito SJ System profile. (Knurek)


08/29/2008 - 1831 Sets

Added:
Numerous Genesis Titles from Knurek + R.Belmont - may too many to list.  The math
seems to indicate over 150 titles have been added.

Removed:
Ray Force (clone of Gunlock) taken out of XML - no unique roms.

Corrected:
Sonic Wings 3 (sonicw3) - Region size was incorrect.

NOTE:  There still may be a couple sets that do not play correctly.  The next M1
core release should correct these problemed Genesis/Megadrive sets.


08/05/2008 - 1675 Sets

You need the latest release of M1 for today's list:
http://rbelmont.mameworld.info/m1078a10-w32.zip
This list is included in the this a10 release!

Added:
- X-Day 2 (xday2) using Namco NA-1/2 profile (Phil Bennett) - I added a ROMOF="CGANGPZL"
to it as a fake parent to allow you to keep your MAME sets unmodified.

- Titanic (Coin dropper) using Tattoo Assassins profile (Washu-Chan).

- Numerous Genesis Titles from R. Belmont and Knurek!!

08/04/2008 - 1649 Sets

Added many sets based on latest M1 release (0.7.8a9) and recent posts at the M1 Forum.
I also simplified all the names for all Genesis/Megadrive titles.
Keep in mind, these adds will only work if you install the latest M1 version released!!

Be sure to update your M1 Install available here:
http://rbelmont.mameworld.info/m1078a9-w32.zip

Then, download and apply the mini-update (.DLL):
http://rbelmont.mameworld.info/out_of_timers.zip


08/01/2008 - 1581 Sets

Added:
Rail Chase 2 (rchase2) under Model 2A/2B/2C profile from MAME 0.126u2 addition.  The music seems like it might
be too fast, I'm not sure.  I couldn't find an OST for reference and it still doesn't work in MAME so it might
require adjustment in the core to play correctly.

Aaron Spelling 1.01 (pinball) (aar_101) under Tattoo Assassins profile.  It's tested and working correctly!

Added another "fake parent" to allow you to hold all your .NV files for the sets in the Seibu SPI profile.
You can place them all in a file called "seibunvs" and save having to repopulate your MAME romsets after an
audit.


07/20/2008 - 1579 Sets

Added:
Galactic Storm (galastrm) profile from Knurek.  Phil Bennett has the same thing in the new adds coming - I'm
adding it now for people to listen to (Even if it's a bit buggy).

Corrected:
Wave Runner (waverunr) - Knurek provided a fix to allow Song 0 to be played.

Virtua Fighter 2 (vf2) to use new rom released in MAME 0.126u1.

Point Blank 2 - Namco 22 version (ptblnk2a) was suffering from the same problem as SCI/SCIJ in which a setting
in CLRMAME didn't share the roms correctly with it's clones.


07/13/2008 - 1578 Sets

Corrected:
joyjoy - loaded rom past end of region (was 131072, supposed to be 262144).  That was my mistake.

maglord, ridhero - both sets had something wrong with the "CPU1" definition line.  It looked ok, but must have
contained a hidden or non-standard character because all I did to fix it was retype that line for both sets and
they load again.  EDIT:  I was 262114 instead of 262144 .. my eyes didn't see it.

sci/scij - Following MAME's standard, the "romof=sci" should be added to reference the parent set.  CLRMAME
mistakenly puts this one file, c09-10.42, into the scij set even though it's source is the same as the parent file,
c09-14.42 - just a different name.  My split romset put the rom in the clone, so I didn't see that the parent should
need to have possession of it.  This is a bug in CLRMAME when dealing with split sets with this particular case.

Thanks Llama from Fujix's BBS for the heads-up on these issues.


07/12/2008 - 1578 Sets

Added:
Wave Runner (waverunr) - submitted from Fujix's BBS (Llama)
DJ Boy (djboyj) - Japanese version with different speech roms.
Special Criminal Investigation (scij) - Japanese version with different speech roms.

In order to assist those who use the 4 sets which require the non-MAME standard c69.bin file to be added with those
sets - I added a ROMOF="CGANGPLZ" to 'steal' the rom from that set so your MAME rom structure can stay intact.
If you made your own roms consisting of all the files in a separate folder, this should have no effect.


07/08/2008 - 1575 Sets

MAME 0.126 Title/romset name updates.  Virtua Fighter 3 (vf3) needed a rom change and subtype change in order to play.


06/23/2008 - 1575 Sets

MAME 0.125u6 Title/romset name updates.  No adds right now.

06/01/2008 - 1575 Sets

04/25/2008 - 1572 Sets

Due to me making mistakes in scanning my sets - a few changes in MAME never got carried over to M1 and resulted
in missing roms (in M1) for most people with an updated MAME set.  Both of these are now 100% to current MAME.

These include:
fightfev - Fight Fever
rbff2 - Real Bout Fatal Fury 2 - The Newcomers


04/24/2008 - 1572 Sets

Just some assorted rom name changes (1942, sidebs) and numerous other game name descriptions updated to
latest MAME (0.124u4) defaults.


04/08/2008 - 1572 Sets

Corrected:

If you do not update your romsets for MAME regularly, you really don't need this particular update.

Lost sets and odd changes again have been re-integrated. (they were in the 11/20 release).  They
